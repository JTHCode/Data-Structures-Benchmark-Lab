# Data Structure Lab
Benchmark analysis/comparisons of different data structures in python.

## 📌 Overview
The purpose of this project is to compare the time/memory efficiency of different data structures in order to determine the optimal data structure based on specific use cases.

## 🚀 Features
- Compare time and memory efficiency across multiple data structures
- Benchmark common operations:
  - Creation (initiation of data structure)
  - General value search (searches for every value that is in the data structure)
  - Min value search
  - Max value search
  - Insertion
  - Deletion
  - Update
  - Range queries
- Visualize performance results
- Compare results accross data sets with different sizes and types of data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core language
- `timeit`, `memory_profiler`, `matplotlib`, etc.
